#Development Prompts & Questions


*"WebSocket connection keeps failing when I try to connect to the Durable Object. I see 'WebSocket connection to 'wss://internal/agent/...' failed' in the browser console."*

*"The frontend is receiving wrong JSON responses from the AI, causing 'Unexpected token' errors when parsing. The AI sometimes returns the correct JSON but with wrong formatting:*

*"chat messages aren't displaying correctly when new suggestions come in. The previous messages disappear and the state isn't being maintained properly across WebSocket messages. How do I implement proper state management for the chat UI?"*

*"chat messages aren't aligning properly - user messages should be on the right, AI messages on the left. The CSS isn't working as expected and the messages are overlapping"*

*"start new session button doesn't disable properly after clicking, and multiple sessions get created. There's no loading state or proper button state management. How do I implement proper button states and prevent double-clicks?"*

*"UI doesn't look good on mobile devices. The chat container is too wide"*

*"When the AI fails or the WebSocket disconnects, there's no backed error displayed"*
